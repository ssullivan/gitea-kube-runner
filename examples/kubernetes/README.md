## Kubernetes Docker in Docker Deployment with `gitea-runner`

NOTE: Docker in Docker (dind) requires elevated privileges on Kubernetes. The current way to achieve this is to set the pod `SecurityContext` to `privileged`. Keep in mind that this is a potential security issue that has the potential for a malicious application to break out of the container context.

NOTE: `dind-docker.yaml` uses the native sidecar pattern (init container with `restartPolicy: Always`), which requires Kubernetes 1.29+ (or 1.28 with the `SidecarContainers` feature gate).

NOTE: A helm chart for `gitea-runner` also exists for easier deployments https://gitea.com/gitea/helm-actions

NOTE: These examples deploy **the runner itself** into Kubernetes; jobs still execute as Docker containers inside the dind sidecar. To instead have the runner create **one Pod per job** on the cluster, see [`examples/kubernetes-jobs`](../kubernetes-jobs) and [docs/kubernetes-backend.md](../../docs/kubernetes-backend.md). The two are independent and can be combined.

Each example persists **two** things, and it is worth knowing which is which:

- `/data` is the runner's working directory. It holds the `.runner` registration file and, optionally, the config file — so the runner re-attaches to the server instead of registering again.
- The Docker daemon's data root holds the images pulled for jobs (`/var/lib/docker` for the dind sidecar, `/home/rootless/.local/share/docker` for `dind-rootless`). It is *not* under `/data`. If you drop this volume, the examples still work, but the image cache is discarded whenever the pod is recreated and every job re-pulls its images.

- [`dind-docker.yaml`](dind-docker.yaml)
  How to create a Deployment and Persistent Volume for Kubernetes to act as a runner. The Docker credentials are re-generated each time the pod connects and does not need to be persisted.

- [`rootless-docker.yaml`](rootless-docker.yaml)
  How to create a rootless Deployment and Persistent Volume for Kubernetes to act as a runner. The Docker credentials are re-generated each time the pod connects and does not need to be persisted.

- [`statefulset-dind.yaml`](statefulset-dind.yaml)
  StatefulSet variant of the dind example. Each replica gets a stable identity and its own persistent volume via `volumeClaimTemplates`, so the runner keeps its `.runner` registration across restarts and reschedules instead of trying to register again.
